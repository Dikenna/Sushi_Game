	This is a sushi game. 
It uses a very basic Java JPanel. The player creates a plate of sushi on the right panel of the window. The plate he creates dictates the price of the plate. It is placed on the sushi belt. Other artificial characters create their own plates and place on the belt as well. Plates are arbitrarily bought from the sushi belt. If a plate stays on the belt for more than 2 turns without being bought, the plate is considered spoilt and thrown off the belt. The Scoreboard displays each player which respect to either how much money he has in his account, how much food he has sold, and how much food each player made that spoilt.
